Random Stripe Generator

Generates randomly striped patterns for knitting, which can be adapted for 
crochet and other craft/visual arts projects. 

The current version outputs a text representation of the rows to the command 
line. Plans for improvement include text knitting patterns and a savable .png 
of the stripe pattern.

Heavily inspired by [biscuitsandjam's Random Stripe Generator](http://www.biscuitsandjam.com/stripe_maker_wt.php), which has been useful to me for pattern 
design in the past.
